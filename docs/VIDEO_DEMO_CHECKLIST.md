# Video Demo Checklist (TikTok / Reels)

Goal: record a vertical clip where gameplay and your face are visible at the same time.

## 1. Setup

1. Open the app on phone (Chrome/Edge recommended).
2. Allow camera + microphone permissions.
3. Keep phone in portrait orientation.
4. Choose deck/time/word count in `Settings`.
5. Return to `Home` and tap `Start Challenge`.

## 2. Recording flow

1. Start system screen recording on the phone.
2. Enter game screen and `Tap anywhere to start`.
3. Speak translations quickly and clearly.
4. Use at least one `skip`/`dalshe` (`дальше`) moment to show the mechanic.
5. Include both:
   - several correct answers in a row (streak growth)
   - at least one miss (to show risk/tension)
6. End on finish overlay with final score.
7. Tap `Save Video` (or `Share Video` if available).

## 3. Recommended 20-30s structure

1. 0-3s: Hook shot on `Home` or game start overlay.
2. 3-14s: Fast streak build, visible score growth.
3. 14-18s: One miss / life loss reaction.
4. 18-25s: Recovery and final push.
5. 25-30s: End card with score + CTA.

## 4. Editing tips

1. Keep cuts fast (0.8x-1.1x speed moments work well).
2. Add subtitles for spoken answers.
3. Keep game SFX audible.
4. Add final CTA text: `Can you beat this score?`
