## Heuristics used in product

1. Hook in first seconds
   - Home and ready overlays show an explicit challenge target (`beat X pts`).
2. High motion and clear feedback loops
   - Combo burst text, hit/miss flashes, urgency timer pulses, streak milestone SFX.
3. Competitive replay structure
   - Local leaderboard + dynamic target score to create rematch pressure.
4. Strong final CTA
   - Finish overlay pushes share/challenge behavior with save/share actions.
5. Human reaction focus
   - Full-screen camera background with transparent gameplay UI for social-native look.

## Important note

No UI pattern guarantees virality. The goal is to maximize watchability and share behavior while keeping gameplay readable and fast on mobile.
